```lrc
[00:31.32] Paul Wall tippin' hit it then all walls flippin'
[00:34.74] Better than all ya'll trippin' bitch what's up?
[00:39.30] Deadboy walkin' see me now everybody watchin'
[00:42.78] Did it now everybody talkin' just like us
[00:47.37] Cashed, I'm a motherfucking mess
[00:49.12] Atleast I say a slurred up speech then I rest in peace
[00:50.93] They want my all but they'll never get the best of me
[00:53.42] I keep the rest locked up then I ditch the key
[00:55.31] See I could go a little harder bring the lava make it hotter
[00:57.19] Gottem' ringing out their shirts like "fuck"
[00:59.11] Carhartt patch 48 up in the back
[01:01.43] Jump straight up out the cage in the trunk
[01:03.57] I don't know the city boy I came up from the gritty
[01:05.06] Tell his parents that we left his body somewhere where it's chilly
[01:07.52] I don't hail from a place where you grow up to be great
[01:09.52] I'm the creep from the motherfucking first ave lake
[01:35.02] 
[01:11.98] I never thought I'd live to see all these fucking dreams
[01:39.98] 
[01:15.50] RIP to the whole fucking scene
[01:18.90] Let it bleed, let it bang
[01:23.23] Bitch I do what I want when I please
[01:27.16] Let it bleed, let it bang
[01:31.26] Bitch I do what I want when I please
